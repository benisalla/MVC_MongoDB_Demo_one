# Spring MVC app using MongoDB and Thymeleaf

## Introduction

This README file is dedicated to my Spring MVC app that I developed using MongoDB and Thymeleaf templating engine during my recent web development demo project about different operations you can perform while using mongodb (crud).

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to develop a web application that would allow managers or admins to manage their clients (or users) in a simple and efficient way. The app would allow admins to perform CRUD operations on users, i.e. create, read, update, and delete users.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the development of this app:
- Spring MVC Framework
- MongoDB (NoSQL database)
- Thymeleaf (templating engine)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Bootstrap

## Functionality 

The app has the following functionalities:
1. Display all all users or just a specific user
2. Add a new user
3. View a user or by name by its ID
4. Update a user
5. Delete a user

## Instructions for Use

To use this app, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/benisalla/MVC_MongoDB_Demo_one.git
```

2. Open the project

Open the project in your IDE of choice.

3. Set up the MongoDB database

- Install MongoDB on your system
- Create a database named `SpringMongoDB_one`
- Create a collection named `users`

4. Run the app

- Run the app by executing it as a Spring Boot app.
- Access the app by typing `http://localhost:8081` in your web browser.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this app serves as a great example of how to use Spring MVC, MongoDB, and Thymeleaf together to create a powerful web application. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to me.
